# Writing tips from Dr.Kuebler

## Before writing

write down whatever you want to say
Outline in a logical way to tell the story
More like a proving process with a summarize word, examples and statements and the final conclusions

## Logic of writing:
- One paragraph: Essentially, you are telling a story to PROVE something. It starts with a statement that summarizes main ideas of this paragraph. Follows with assumptions. What experimental methods were used, what observations to support the final conclusion
- Between paragraphs: The meaning needs to be continuous between paragraphs.


## After Writing
- Cut all the unnecessary words
- Check spelling errors including:
  - Font
  - Size
  - Space between number and unit
- Check formatting
