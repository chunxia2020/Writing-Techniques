# Writing tips from Dr.Kuebler

## Before writing

write down whatever you want to say
Outline in a logical way to tell the story
More like a proving process with a summarize word, examples and statements and the final conclusions

## After Writing
- Cut all the unnecessary words
- Check spelling errors including:
  - Font
  - Size
  - Space between number and unit
- Check formatting
