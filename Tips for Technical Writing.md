# Writing tips from Dr.Kuebler

## Before writing

write down whatever you want to say
Outline in a logical way to tell the story
More like a proving process with a summarize word, examples and statements and the final conclusions

## Logic of writing:
- One paragraph: Essentially, you are telling a story to PROVE something. It starts with a statement that summarizes main ideas of this paragraph. Follows with assumptions. What experimental methods were used, what observations to support the final conclusion
- Between paragraphs: The meaning needs to be continuous between paragraphs.


## After Writing
- Cut all the unnecessary words
- Check spelling errors including:
  - Font
  - Size
  - Space between number and unit
- Check formatting
-

## A list of mistakes I made

 - Formatting consistent throughout the doc file
 - a, an, the
 - Italicize variables
 - et al.
 - exit**ing** lens and focus**ing** to a spot (Keep grammatical forms the same)
 - Repetitive phrasing
 - Use binding spaces `ctrl`+`shift`+`space` to keep numbers with units or leading headers. Don't let they split across multiple lines
 - 25.2 μm, 50.4 μm, 252.0 μm, 2520.1 μm, 5040.3 μm, and 25201.6 μm (Repeat units after each value)
 - *x*-axis ; *xy*-plane
 - 100 m**L** Use standard SI Units
 - E- to L-band
 - Avoid sub-sub scrips. Write as ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n_%7Beff%2Cmax%7D)
 - Figure font size thumbnail: Lettering in a figure should be no more than about two points smaller than main text text size.
 - Reference
  - Do not use et al. Use all authors.
  - Journal title: Title caps. Example: Optical Express
  - Titles of papers: Sentence case (Only the first letter of the sentence)
  - Gallagher, W. J.
  - Conference: if it is a proceeding,.... location and date (Follow reference of optical letters) instructions for authors...
  - Books and publishers require city name
